I'm going to share a story that might sound quite strange to you as you read this. I was 19 years old and wanted to explore anal sex! And that's exactly what it was! How did I come up with this idea? Let's just say that during my journey of self-discovery, I started to explore that part of my body and found myself enjoying the concept. I was never a big fan of porn, but I do remember becoming somewhat obsessed with those more intense films where big guys pushed everything inside women. I always had a bit of a submissive streak, coupled with an appreciation for a little pain.

Usually, I would give up on pursuing these fantasies; I didn't have a boyfriend, and let's be honest, men can be complicated. Any show of sexual freedom tends to get you labeled as promiscuous. In short, I wanted to share my lovely backside but had no partner for a proper encounter. It was utterly disappointing!

It took about eight months for the idea to transition into action. During that time, I had a couple of flings with guys—one was just some light kissing, and with the other, I wasn't feeling well that day, plus he was a terrible person, so I didn't even want a second date. The rest were just encounters with other girls. Why don't women have penises? That could have been so much fun. I honestly considered asking a gay friend; he would probably be up for it, but it wouldn’t be the same. I bet he would just laugh in my face the whole time.

One day, luck was on my side. I was looking fabulous on my way back to my shared apartment to meet the girls when I noticed someone moving in next door. The previous tenant was also a student, a sweet guy but pretty unfortunate-looking. The new tenant caught me snooping around during his move. My goodness, when I saw him, I couldn’t believe it—the girls in the apartment would go wild over him! His name was Tito; he was very tall, had brown hair, a square face with a strong chin, and a remarkably fit body. That sight made me feel all sorts of ways, if you catch my drift!

“Hi, good morning! Are you my neighbor?”

“Oh! Yes, I was just curious about who was moving in! Sorry for being so nosy.”

“No worries! It’s nice to know there are people from the college around here!”

We chatted for a bit; I tried to mark my territory by getting his number, flirting as much as I could, suggested grabbing a drink together, and, of course, asked if he was seeing anyone.

“No, I had to move from another city, and we thought it was best to break things off. I can't afford to be flying back and forth for visits, and we hadn't been together long… You know how it is,” he said, sounding a bit sad.

“Aww, poor thing! Look! I can keep you company today; do you need help? I can lend a hand or come back later!”

“I’m almost done; I don’t have much stuff, and the apartment is furnished. I’ll step out to grab some food and think we can meet up tonight.”

Little did he know, he was about to have an exciting evening ahead!

Now, I’m ready to share the most embarrassing part of this whole saga. The grocery store and pharmacy were less than 100 meters from our building, right next to each other. I stashed my things in the apartment, had a quick bite to eat, and remembered that I needed to stop by the pharmacy to prepare for my date. I grabbed my bag and dashed downstairs to get everything ready. There I was, in line at the checkout with my basket of items when, behind me, Tito appeared, holding some hygiene products and condoms. He glanced at my basket, examining each item, then looked at me, and I had no idea where to hide my face. In my basket, I had waxing strips, an enema kit, condoms, intimate soap, lubricant, and that was it—a full-on naughty kit, a clear sign that I was planning on getting busy! I tried to angle the basket away, but there was no way to hide it, and I felt like disappearing from that spot as quickly as possible. I feigned composure, wearing a forced smile…

“So, did you get settled in okay?”

“Yeah, I’m heading to the store now after this, and I’ll wait for you tonight.”

At least we both knew we wanted to get together after that. After paying and packing up, I bolted out of the pharmacy like a rocket, crossing the street without waiting for him to finish his shopping. I was mortified.

Back home, I spent the rest of the afternoon getting ready—I shaved, did a face mask, and of course, tidied up down there to avoid any surprises. I put on a cute dress and waited for the right moment to knock on his door. My friends asked where I was off to, noticing I wasn’t dressed for just any outing, but I certainly wasn’t about to tell them my plans.

When the time came, he welcomed me with a smile, wearing just shorts—no shirt. Honestly, he could have been completely naked for all I cared, but I admit that seeing him without a shirt was a bit odd. If he aimed to impress me, he did so in both positive and negative ways. He leaned in and gave me a slow kiss on the cheek, which felt more like a lingering scent. I hugged him back tightly, as if we were already close friends, and for the first time, I felt his bulge. Of course, I was concerned about the size; I wasn’t completely out of my mind, and it was indeed impressive!

There was no chit-chat, not even a glass of water offered. Before I knew it, his lips were close to mine, and I only had time to shut my eyes and receive his warm kiss. I held my breath, surprised and nervous as his tongue danced with mine, creating a beautifully choreographed ballet. Our mouths fit together perfectly, the kiss deepening as our bodies pressed closer. My hands wandered over his torso while he held me tightly in his arms, seemingly reluctant to let me go!

His erection was already pressing against the fabric of his shorts, which couldn’t contain it any longer. I instinctively reached down and began to stroke him. He was warm and slick, and my man let out a soft moan as he wriggled free from his shorts. Still kissing in the hallway, I found my hands free now, so I started to pleasure him, giving my hand a good lick to ease the process. I spread his legs a bit, and my other hand went right to his sack, where I gently squeezed with my nails, pulling down to send shivers through him. His body was pliant under my touches; he couldn’t react, fully surrendering to me. At times, I squeezed his buttocks, sliding my finger between his cheeks, teasing his anus from above. When I brushed against it, he shivered slightly.

“Do you like that?”

“Yes,” he replied shyly. “I’ve just never done anything like this.”

“Do you trust me?”

“Yes.”

That idea popped into my head suddenly. I had never done this before, but it filled me with excitement right then and there. He took my hand and led me to the bedroom, and I was still dressed, not even having put down my bag, while he was completely naked. In the bedroom, I said:

“Lie down on your stomach for me?”

He complied, and after freeing myself from my bag and clothes, I settled on his back, kissing and massaging him. I rubbed my breasts and my core against his buttocks, and he felt so good; his back was muscular and well-defined. I could hear a wet sound as I rubbed against him, my scent filling the air—a scent of a turned-on woman.

I moved down to massage and kiss his backside; with each squeeze and lick, he opened up more for me… “Could I get him on all fours?”

That thought crossed my mind. I had never seen a man like this in bed, and I was both curious and excited to try it out. I didn’t know exactly what to do; I wasn’t sure if I could push my finger inside him. I came here for him to have anal sex with me, not the other way around!

I pulled him up, and he didn’t resist, getting on all fours in a very feminine way, which was an incredibly stimulating sight. I squeezed his buttocks with both hands, licking between his sack and anus. He began to move his hips, showing me where he wanted my tongue to go. First, I teased him, avoiding direct contact, but eventually, I gave in. My hands reached for the lubricant in my bag nearby while I continued to kiss his balls. When I began to stroke him as if I were milking a cow, he let out a loud moan, and I thought he might climax soon. I didn’t stop; he was breathing heavily and moaning loudly. I gave his butt a playful smack! I had always wanted to do that, and he didn’t complain!

My mouth traveled from his sack straight to his anus. His skin there was smooth and hairless, almost feminine. I licked around his opening, gently pushing my tongue against it. I have to admit, I wanted to stick a finger inside, but I was afraid he might get upset, so I descended to suck on his cock while massaging his balls, keeping my thumb pressed firmly against his anus.

I was in a bit of an awkward position, but with his member drawn down and back, I took the head of his cock fully into my mouth. I focused on his body to find a rhythm. What began as grunts transformed into moans until incoherent words and curses started to emerge. I got a warning:

“Stop, or I’m going to cum in your mouth!”

“Thanks for the heads-up, buddy!” I thought, but I ignored him and took him deeper, wanting him to release everything in my mouth, gripping him with all my strength. I felt him tremble, his muscles spasming visibly, and after a shout of pleasure, he flopped forward, laughing. He came hard, everything he had going straight down my throat; I gagged a little but swallowed it all.

“Wow, that was amazing! I need a moment to recover.”

“I can imagine!” I laughed at my own audacity; I genuinely enjoyed that experience!
