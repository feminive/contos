The group was brimming with excitement for the weekend! We had planned to embark on a trek in a breathtaking location. My target would be there, and I was eager to steal a kiss from that boy. The dilemma lay in the fact that we had never found a moment to connect. A friend confided in me that he felt shy about approaching me, believing I was "too much" for him and fearing rejection. Poor guy, he was such a fool! My cheeks were already aching from smiling at him, and anything more would be rubbing my desire to be with him directly in his face.

He was stunning; in truth, it was my own insecurities that made me perceive his apparent disinterest, thinking I wasn't as attractive as he was—just the typical woes of a woman. However, things were looking up; it seemed like we were about to hit a stride, as during the week leading up to the hike, we exchanged numerous messages, some of them playfully suggestive, and ultimately agreed to be walking partners in case we got lost—and I was more than ready to lose myself in the woods with him!

On the day of the trek, I opted, as always, for light clothing, underneath wearing one of the few dark panties I had; sometimes you need to relieve yourself in the wild, and accidents do happen! With a very light backpack holding just the essentials and a cap perched atop my hair, I went to meet the group. He was already there, smiling at me as I arrived. I approached him, and he took my hand, embracing me warmly and kissing my cheek. I flushed with embarrassment, and my friends, being the silly ones they are, smiled teasingly at me. I delighted in the fact that after greeting me, he didn’t let go; he remained closely by my side, his arm wrapped around my waist as if we were truly a couple.

I could feel his firm musculature pressing against me, sending delightful shivers through my body as I blushed frequently, utterly smitten and surrendered to him. In our conversations, I often lingered on his captivating smile framed by his rugged, square jaw; he sported a messy blonde beard that lent him a charmingly disheveled look, perfectly complementing his gray eyes. Gradually, I allowed myself to be touched, drawing closer to him. He would occasionally play with my hair, gazing into my eyes sparkling with excitement, and in those moments, I always thought: _“Now, he’s finally going to kiss me!”_ But there were onlookers around, and I didn’t want witnesses to that intimate act.

On the bus, he pulled me toward the back seats, the action abrupt, devoid of conversation or request. Long, deliciously slow kisses swept us away, making us oblivious to the passage of time. His kiss was something extraordinary, incredibly perfect! I felt my body responding, growing soft and sensitive, while our touches became slightly more playful. Boldly, my hand traced along his thigh and stomach, skirted the area of my own desire; I sensed him becoming aroused, though I lacked the courage to confirm it. At one point, I felt something pressing against the waistband of his pants, igniting a wild urge to let my hand explore, but prudence held me back. Had the journey taken a few more moments, things might have escalated tremendously; unfortunately, we arrived, and I disembarked from the bus with swollen lips and a flushed face—the atmosphere among my friends was charged with curiosity; we were the couple of the moment, and I could see the hidden giggles when they glanced our way!

At the trail's beginning, there was a sort of assembly focused on safety, which, of course, we paid no heed to. We adjusted our gear and began our hike, setting ourselves apart from the rest of the group.

— And… what if? — he said enigmatically, surveying the surroundings.

— "What if" what, boy? — He didn’t need to elaborate; I knew he longed to whisk me away to some secluded spot, far from the curious eyes of others; he was merely toying with me.

— That sign says there’s a fork ahead; I heard that hardly anyone takes that path since it requires climbing gear. We could linger there for a while and then return to the entrance; what do you think?

I wanted to say no, but a mischievous grin spread across my flushed face, betraying all the intentions I was trying to conceal. And so we went. Always moving backward, we conversed as if it were any other trail, step by step distancing ourselves further from the group.

Almost an hour in, a sign appeared before us. Friends were nowhere to be seen, and we quickened our pace, following the wrong path. We searched for a more secluded area and stumbled upon a trail leading to a stream. There, our stage unfolded before our eyes as we parted the green curtain of vegetation that had blocked our view; a beautifully flowering ipê, its low canopy littered with bright yellow petals, painted the ground below. The place felt like a dream, as if a piece of paradise lay right in front of us. The air was rich with greenery, and the cool shade amidst the warm sun eased the fatigue from our hike, while the gentle flow of the stream created a soothing melody.

We washed our faces in the creek and settled beneath the tree, surrounded by fallen petals that framed the moment like a painting. The sweat from our exertions still trickled down our bodies when his hands began to roam the curves of mine, gliding beneath the fabric in search of the most intimate parts of my skin, as if seeking an oasis in a barren desert.

His lips found mine, igniting an overwhelming desire that engulfed all my senses, dissolving any sense of space or time. Each touch from him was a promise, a boundary on the brink of being crossed. I waited, eager for his hand to breach the final barrier, and when that moment arrived, he would discover me like a dam bursting, overflowing with relentless waves of pleasure that would envelop him in the force of my surrender.

Without asking, my clothes were pushed down; the gentle breeze that brushed against my heated core sent a shiver down my spine, while his hand cupped me, warming my very essence. My body arched in response, balancing on the tips of my toes, entirely supported by him, as within me his strong, thick fingers danced in a way that made time stand still, allowing us to fully experience that exquisite pleasure.

I craved more, surrendering myself to him, prostrating like an animal before that tree, exposing myself in the shadow where everything hidden was finally laid bare, and he joined with me in a primal union, his firm presence sending ripples through my body, eliciting shivers of delight. The contact was intense, akin to fire meeting dry wood, igniting a flame that grew with each passing moment. His movements began slowly, almost reverently, but soon gained momentum, filling the silence with sounds of ecstasy and sighs. The world around us faded, leaving only the rhythmic pulse of our bodies, wholly immersed in the fervor of the moment.

I was taken like a filly, fiercely and ceaselessly, pain and pleasure intertwining as long-lost friends, bringing forth a rising tide, gentle yet inevitable, carrying me to a place where time seemed suspended. It felt as though every nerve in my body was a finely tuned string, vibrating in perfect harmony. A delicate warmth unfurled, slow at first, until it erupted in waves of light and fire, consuming all in its path.

My breath mingled with his, and in that instant, we were not two, but one singular entity, a universe pulsating in unison. The world around us vanished, leaving only the sweet surrender, the embrace of ecstasy that filled every void. And when the calm descended, within me remained the warm, liquid remnants announcing that he was unable to respond to further stimuli.

We sat among the flowers, weary as they were, exhausted as if life itself had drained from us. In the fullness of beauty, we had reached the end.
