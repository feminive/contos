My first encounter with a boy was quite a memorable experience! I was young and spirited, always getting into mischief, kissing both boys and girls, my desires burning like a flame that could ignite the entire city. The only reason I hadn’t ventured into anything more before that day was the lack of a private space, which is why my first time happened in a small room where the residents of the building stored their bicycles. I remember that day vividly—it was a Friday during an extended holiday, and the condominium was eerily quiet. Dressed in a skirt, I ventured out to meet him.

We embraced, but everything was still above the clothing—my heart raced as I returned home and found myself indulging in some self-pleasure! I recall desperately wanting to touch him, but the poor boy was rather slow. He waited for me down at the playground, and we quickly immersed ourselves in kisses! It didn’t take long before we sought a place away from prying eyes. I remember wanting to go without any underwear that day, but my courage faltered, and I ended up wearing a simple pair. We had just found this new hideaway—the bike storage wasn’t frequented often, and the sound of approaching footsteps would alert us.

Inside, he pushed me against the wall and began to caress my backside. It was amusing how he did it, as if he thought that would drive me wild; at best, he succeeded in pushing my panties inward! During our passionate exploration, I finally mustered the courage to reach beneath his shorts, feeling something substantial there—his excitement was undeniable. When I squeezed for the first time, he let out a soft moan, and I waited for his next move, but nothing came… The kisses continued, and he began to trail down to my neck, sending shivers down my spine! He playfully nibbled on my collarbone, and I lost myself in pleasure, releasing soft moans to entice him further, which made him grin with delight.

My curious companion then ventured toward my chest. I lowered the strap of my blouse, exposing my right breast to him. My chest had always been firm and attractive, the rosy areola a perfect complement to its size. To this day, I can recall the sensation vividly; it was a bit chilly that day, and the contrast with his warm, moist mouth sent electric thrills throughout my body, particularly down below! I could feel myself getting wet—no doubt about it. I think it was his first experience with a breast, as he lingered on my right side for quite some time, seemingly forgetting that I had another! He only switched when I guided him to the other side. I had never felt anything like it; at times, he nibbled a bit roughly, yet overall, it was delightful! I wanted nothing more than to remain in that moment.

Eventually, my hand grew tired from teasing him through his clothes, and I decided to free him from his constraints. The heat surprised me; that was my initial reaction, but I felt terribly shy! I began what I thought was a proper hand job, amused by the expressions on his face as I awkwardly moved my hand back and forth. My hand wasn’t particularly large, and I struggled to encompass him fully. Suddenly, he took it upon himself to explore beneath my skirt and over my panties. I wanted to act coy, to play hard to get, but I relented. He had already given me a few playful squeezes, so I was somewhat familiar with the sensation. I yearned to take him into my mouth, and it seemed he could read my thoughts as he prompted me to do so before I could speak.

Leaning in, I grabbed hold and took a close look—my goodness, while a penis is pleasurable, it is also quite peculiar, isn’t it? My first thought was: “_How on earth will this fit inside me? It’ll tear me apart!_”

He was undeniably large, with a shiny tip, slightly wet, and circumcised; I found the head to be the most appealing part. After a brief inhale, as a friend had advised me, I took him into my mouth! I had no experience with oral sex but had seen a few videos, so I did my best with what I knew. That warm flesh with soft skin felt heavenly in my mouth, and the taste and scent heightened my arousal. In my mind, I repeated a mantra, “_Sucking and stroking!_” I thought I was doing quite well, but he pulled away a couple of times to avoid climaxing. Although I wanted to continue, he asked me to pause, indicating he wanted to do something else and couldn’t while I was occupied. When he pulled me in for a kiss, he slipped his fingers beneath my panties; it felt like there was a button deep within me that made me smile—it was only a light touch, but I trembled all over, my knees buckling under the weight of pleasure. He held me up, his hand still at play, and I bit down on my hand to stifle my cries, fearing I would echo throughout the building. All I could manage to say was, “_Hold me, hold me!_” I quivered and moved in rhythm with his fingers, which were exploring with an awkward intensity. I wrapped my arms around myself for support. What followed was a rush of sensations; as soon as he inserted his finger, a wave of euphoria washed over me, lingering for at least a minute. When he finally reached his peak, I believe I may have accidentally wet his hand—poor guy! I felt something trickling down, tickling between my legs. It was the first time someone brought me to ecstasy, and I was elated. My chest tightened; I could only emit breathy sounds as my face contorted, and my hand ached from the pressure of my bite.

Once I regained my composure, I lowered myself to take him into my mouth again, relishing the sensation of having a penis there. In truth, I still enjoy it immensely. Fully composed, he put on a condom, and I began searching for a place to sit or lie down, but there was none. The only option was to turn my back to the wall, raising my hips high. He grasped my sides and pulled me closer, yet I wanted to see what was happening behind me, which was impossible. He urged me to bend further, positioning me at nearly a ninety-degree angle. I felt something stretching me, grazing my insides; anxiety surged through me as I tensed, fearing pain. He attempted several times to find the right angle, and I guided him to the correct spot. Finally, his considerable length slid inside me, and I gasped, “_Oh my God!_” I felt utterly filled, leaving me weak once more.

His initial thrusts were slow and slightly painful, my inner walls reluctant to yield. I held him back, not allowing him to plunge in all at once, fearing injury. But he was gentle, pumping slowly until I felt the pressure on my bladder and an overwhelming urge to urinate. I thought, “_Oh dear! Not now!_” As he pushed, I could feel the outline forming beneath my belly. When I finally felt ready, I allowed him to proceed. He thrust with vigor, pounding relentlessly. Occasionally, he would hit a sensitive spot that stung, but I endured. I stifled my moans, desperate not to cry out. I wanted to shed tears as I felt him hitting my clitoris, a sensation that unexpectedly ignited a desire that would inspire many more moments of self-pleasure in the future.

When he climaxed, it struck me as amusing; his movements became erratic, and I couldn’t help but chuckle at the situation as I waited for him to finish. We lingered in that space, kissing and caressing for a while before dressing and exiting through the corridor, where the doorman called out to us:

— “Hey… you two need to be more careful with the cameras, okay?”

Upon hearing that, I held my breath, sprinting back into the building towards my home, utterly mortified.
