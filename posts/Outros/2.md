This is the second part of the tale, [click here for the first part of this erotic story.](https://feminivefanfics.com.br/EroticStories/i-gave-myself-to-the-neighbor-part-i "Erotic tale in two parts")

Having regained my composure, he rose and settled beside me. We exchanged a few words while his arousal began to stir once more.

— You were quite intense, I remarked, attempting to ease the tension.

— Indeed, it was delightful, and now it’s your turn to engage.

Come! I urged, spreading my legs and gently guiding his head down toward my core. Yet, he paused to kiss me softly, caressing my breasts; I longed for him to take me in his mouth, though his touch was exquisite. His hand moved from my thighs up to my breasts; he lavished attention on my left breast while his fingers explored my ample folds, sending delightful shivers through me. I opened myself further to him, urging his mouth to suck more fervently.

— Like a baby, yes, that’s how I like it—harder! Suck me!—I commanded with authority.

He complied, sucking vigorously at my breast while his fingers made circular motions just above my clitoris, hitting the precise spot. I writhed in rhythm with his movements, my body arching in pleasure. Suddenly, he pushed two fingers inside me and moved down to my clitoris, diving straight into the act without hesitation. I was ready, his experience evident in every stroke. His sucking was firm, deliciously intense, with a gentle tongue at the right angle and fingers exerting the perfect pressure. My eyes rolled back, and I implored:

— Just add a finger behind, there’s lubricant over there!

It was unnecessary, as I was already overflowing with moisture beneath. Tenderly, a third finger found its way to my anus, beginning to explore. He entered, creating a delightful pressure that heightened the pleasure coursing through me. I was on the brink of ecstasy; my belly tightened, and I involuntarily sat up, releasing a cry as I arched back, swept away by a wave of orgasm so powerful it left me writhing under the sensations he evoked with his fingers in every orifice.

I sat there beside him, who smiled at me as though he had performed admirably. He leaned in, and we shared kisses and laughter; I could easily imagine myself falling for this man, who had proven to be quite skilled in bed.

— Lie down; let me worship you!

He reclined, and I positioned myself between his legs, leaning forward. His member was large and beautiful; I found myself captivated, teasing him playfully as I brushed it against my face. We shared laughter in that moment. I kissed my way from the base to the tip, taking him fully into my mouth, swirling my tongue as I gradually increased my pace, simultaneously caressing him with my other hand. I fondled his testicles as well, eliciting soft groans of pleasure from him. Gradually, I intensified the oral pleasure, taking him deeper and deeper; his member was a delight, perfect and exquisite. Just then, he nudged my head, and when I glanced up, I saw him offering me the lubricant. At that moment, I thought it was for preparing for penetration, but a spark of curiosity prompted me to ask, sensing an unresolved matter from our encounter.

— What’s that for? Do you want me to lubricate it for sitting or something else?

— You can do whatever you wish; I’ll allow it!

I understood the message; he desired a little exploration! I was taken aback by surprise. As you might have gathered, I had been somewhat preoccupied with such matters lately, and the urge to engage in this exploration surged within me. I applied a bit of lubricant to my fingers while alternating between sucking and stroking him. My lubricated finger descended toward his anus, pressing gently at the entrance, feeling the tightness as he resisted my advance.

— You don’t want this?

— You can go ahead; I’m just a bit tense, the young man replied.

— Spread your legs wide.

Once again, he opened himself to me, surrendering completely. In that moment, a whirlwind of emotions engulfed me; first, arousal, then a wave of laughter at the sight of him like a maiden receiving her first intimate experience. Yet, I soon felt a twinge of discomfort but recognized it as my own prejudices speaking, deciding to focus on his pleasure. I knew I had to stimulate his prostate, though I was uncertain of its location, so I allowed my finger to enter and began to explore.

— I’m not sure how to do this; just guide me, okay?

His response was somewhat indistinct, yet I interpreted his moan as an affirmation and continued. At that moment, I maintained my oral attention while simultaneously stroking his member, my finger moving in and out of him. Why not try two fingers? I thought, adding more lubricant and managing to insert another finger with relative ease. He lost himself in pleasure, moaning blissfully with a delightful expression on his face! Such a beautiful sight!

His member was rock-hard, and without withdrawing my fingers, I turned around, sitting upon him to ride. My vagina embraced him like a warm glove; our connection was sublime. The sensation of being filled by his warmth was indescribable! I rode him from behind, my hips moving in a languid rhythm. I knew he had a privileged view of me in that position. His hands gripped my cheeks tightly, dictating the tempo, pushing me forward and back as I accompanied the thrusts, pushing my fingers deep within him.

This moment was unlike anything I had ever experienced; the scent of passion, the sweat of our bodies ignited an incredible desire within me. I knew I could climax at any moment as I began to set my own pace. And so, I planted my feet firmly on the bed and started to descend violently, stimulating him while seated. I felt that delightful presence striking the depths of my being, and then came a jolt of overwhelming sensation, a blend of ecstasy and fury, an orgasm so intense that later, my friends would tell me they heard my cries from the neighboring apartment. I held on as tightly as I could, the effects lingering with me for several moments. When I finally returned to reality, I felt something warm and new within me; he had climaxed as well, pleading for me to stop. Slowly, I eased my rhythm, withdrawing my fingers and rotating around to face him, still seated upon his firm member.

— You’ll have to endure just a little more! I said playfully, almost threateningly!

I checked my anus, inserting a finger to gauge the ease of entry, and I felt completely relaxed. I applied lubricant generously, arching slightly to remove him and positioning the head of his member at my other entrance. “It feels a little soft; it may be challenging to enter, but at least it might be easier to endure, as he is quite large for me,” I thought.

The tip entered, and the lubricant did its job well. It felt as if an adult's arm were making its way inside me; I quickly began to think that perhaps this was not the best idea. I shifted slightly to accommodate him and gripped his arms to prevent him from thrusting too forcefully. The sensation was intense, and focusing on my breathing helped ease the discomfort. I adjusted myself over him, allowing him to slide deeper within me.

— Please stay still; don’t move! I instructed.

I struggled to articulate what he was doing at that moment as I was wholly focused on the task at hand, pain overtaking me. He attempted to caress my breasts, but I distinctly remember pushing his hands away. “Did I choose a poor position?” I pondered, considering all the possible missteps I might have taken, but nothing seemed to alleviate the discomfort. I surrendered, knowing the initial experience often comes with pain, and began to move gently. I must admit, it was less than pleasant, at best reaching a moderate level of comfort. The realization of having a full member within me somehow empowered me, though I could not quite explain why. I began to mimic the movements I had seen in films, almost withdrawing entirely before plunging back in, though it did not improve significantly. He was wild with pleasure from my actions. “What will he think of me?” I felt my reputation falter in that moment.

Nevertheless, despite it all, it was an intriguing experience, and I found myself wishing to repeat it when the opportunity arose again. I managed to hold on for a few minutes; it became slightly more tolerable as he softened. However, since I was still in discomfort, I decided to pause. I returned home in the early hours of dawn, reflecting on how splendid our encounter had been, and we engaged in it many more times. Many wonderful and wild things occurred afterward, which I promise to share another time!
