In the darkness of a ten-hour night bus journey, I found myself lost in thought, stretched out across two empty seats. The air was thick with the scent of dampness from a recent cleaning, and the air conditioning chilled me to the bone, leaving my throat parched. Alone, I was accompanied only by the shadow of fear. Men would pass by, staring at the sight of a young woman in a pretty dress, ready to make crude remarks or gaze at me with lustful eyes. I silently prayed none would dare to sit beside me and strike up a conversation; the bus was not overly crowded, which added to my unease.

Sleep eluded me as I lay beneath a blanket, my head resting on a pillow, listening to music through my earbuds while reflecting on life. I couldn't shake the memories of a past love, a relationship that ended in turmoil, yet I clung to the beautiful moments we shared. We traveled together, creating art in various places, and I recalled how we first met on a bus, indulging in each other during the ride, nearly awakening those around us with our soft moans. I was certain someone had heard our whispers and gasps. Oh, how he had such a magnificent endowment! Just thinking of it sends warmth coursing through me... During one late-night drive, I had pleasure with him for a solid stretch of 50 kilometers! That rogue climaxed without warning, and in an instant, I pulled away, a tidal wave of warmth hitting my eye, leaving me momentarily blinded from irritation. A mischievous grin spread across my face as I recognized my folly, and I couldn't help but chuckle softly.

Carried away by the flood of memories, my body began to respond beneath the blanket, the fabric and my thoughts making me lightly perspire. My arms crossed tightly against my chest, one hand teasingly gliding over my left breast, pinching gently. An unexpected moisture formed in my panties, igniting a spark of excitement within me. I felt tingling sensations, my thighs pressing together as if to crush something hidden within, until a hand descended... I squeezed tightly between my legs, but the layers of fabric were abundant. _*"Could I indulge a little here without anyone noticing?"* ---_ the thought stirred a restlessness in me. I straightened like a meerkat in my seat and glanced around to observe the other passengers; they all appeared to be asleep. Biting my lips, I wore a confident expression. Like a contortionist, I slipped my arms beneath the straps of my bra, pulling the clasp forward until it was free, tumbling into my handbag.

With one strap of my dress slipping down and hidden beneath the blanket, I squeezed my breast now free from its confines, ready to conceal it at the slightest movement nearby. The touch on my breast was pleasant, yet I craved more; the idea both thrilled and unnerved me. I fashioned the blanket into a makeshift tent, hooking my thumbs beneath my shorts and panties, and with a feline grace, I removed them in one swift motion, the skirt of my dress draping over my lower half. The icy air brushed against me, sending shivers coursing through my body. _"Oh my God, what have I become?"_ *---* I often judged myself harshly...

My pubic hair stood tall as usual; it had been weeks since I last saw a razor or wax, and this environment was not meant for visitors. A gentle stroke down the middle... I was cautious not to spread everything across my thighs and end up in a sticky mess. Returning to my breast, now glistening with moisture, I began to caress it softly with the other hand. My heart thumped steadily as my breath grew unsteady. I turned my face toward the window, gazing at the landscape, but the image of his toned body and sculpted chest flashed vividly in my mind, a clear vision of him, firm and well-defined, not overly muscular but far from skinny, with an impressive manhood that always seemed to escape his underwear when aroused.

Unbeknownst to me, my fingers betrayed their intentions, finding warmth and dampness beneath my touch; I was soaking wet. With the first caress, my body tightened in response. My fingers traced along my delicate folds, searching for hidden pleasure, occasionally venturing further back to discover sensations that had once thrilled me. I stifled an inaudible gasp, squeezing my eyes shut, blocking out the world outside. In my mind, he was atop me, pressing his weight down, dominating me with his roughness. I relished when he tangled his fingers in my hair, claiming me, making me submit to his desires. I moved my hand slowly, wishing it were his member gliding against me. My fingers found their way to my clitoris, swollen and eager, moving in gentle circles, and when the pleasure intensified, I switched to a stronger up-and-down motion, applying more pressure... I fought to suppress any sounds; if anyone were to pass by to use the restroom, they would catch a glimpse of my peculiar position, even concealed beneath the blanket.

As the memory of his shaft filling me surged through my thoughts, I curled my fingers inside, mimicking the motions I adored. How do I love to touch myself? Two fingers in, two fingers out! An infallible recipe for me. I adjusted myself in the seat, now lying on my back, and unabashedly thrust both fingers deep inside, reaching the depths of my being, relishing the sensation of my own texture. At that moment, it became increasingly difficult to hold back; I never preferred to climax quickly, but here, it was a necessity. Knowing myself well, I quickened my pace, focusing on my clitoris to find the rhythm that would lead to release. Inside, the movements grew forceful and vigorous, causing a delightful ache, yet I knew I could endure it; my hands pumped faster as my arousal peaked, my fingers growing weary. I writhed in ecstasy, the blanket slipping away, and I had to secure it with my chin. Faces and expressions danced across my features as I prayed no one would witness my wild indulgence.

Two fingers were insufficient; there was room for another, and I granted myself that pleasure. I loved the feeling of fullness, embracing the sensation of being filled, and it ignited a fire within me. Despite my vigorous pace, the climax eluded me; I envisioned him there, sucking on my breasts... Four fingers delved deep, while two continued their rhythmic dance, my breath hitched, and when I inhaled, it came in desperate gasps. I longed for five! I craved the entirety of his hand, his arm... his full length inside me, yearning for the sensation of his balls slapping against my backside!

I came hard, oh so hard!

I howled like a wounded creature, stifling the sound as I was paralyzed by the shock of my release. I trembled, the now-chilled air brushing against my skin, and as my movements ceased, my heartbeat gradually slowed, replaced by a fleeting sense of abandonment. A satisfied smile lingered on my face. _"Oh, what a naughty girl you are!"_ *---* I mused, checking to see if anyone had noticed.

Assessing my situation, it appeared I had made quite the mess, and I laughed, cleaning myself with a moist tissue. I composed myself, adjusting my clothes, and drifted into a blissful slumber.
