We were at odds. He never attended to the household chores as he ought to and left everything in disarray. I, ever so particular about order and cleanliness, could not endure such negligence. The argument had been fierce, and for three days, we exchanged scarcely a word. The house was laden with a heavy, tense silence. Yet, on that Saturday morning, he discovered an unexpected and special way to break the ice and draw us closer once more.

Still drowsy, I lingered in bed. The space beside me was empty and cold, a clear indication that he had risen some time ago. I would not call out to him; pride and hurt still echoed loudly. I remained there, attempting to shake off the morning lethargy, until I heard a sound emanating from the kitchen.

There were noises of movement: drawers opening and closing, dishes being arranged, the flow of water in the sink. Amidst this, his voice shattered the silence:

— Love, where is the laundry detergent?

That was our dynamic. We would argue, remain stony-faced for days, and then he would try to win me over in some way. But deep down, I knew: these changes never lasted. His efforts, no matter how sweet, always ended up being small and insufficient.

I slowly rose, wearing that resigned air of someone who knows the day hadn't begun as they hoped. I stretched at the edge of the bed, feeling the lingering heaviness of sleep in my muscles, and quickly tied my hair back with a scrunchie. In no rush, I slipped on my slippers, adjusted my light sleepwear, and made my way toward the kitchen, already bracing myself to reprimand him. After all, it was not uncommon for him to start something and leave it half-finished.

However, as I crossed the threshold, my irritation was interrupted in an almost comical manner. There he was, a bit awkward yet clearly making an effort. Young, with defined muscles accentuated by the exertion of his movements, he wore only a rather questionable floral apron that barely covered what was necessary, his physique bulging beneath the fabric, revealing a strong back and a rounded, soft backside. The scene was so unexpected that a laugh escaped before I could rein it in.

— What is this? Why are you cleaning the kitchen in the nude? — I asked, attempting to sound annoyed, but the curve of my smile betrayed my tone.

He turned, feigning innocence, holding a dish towel in one hand and wearing that cheeky smile. The apron drew my gaze, appearing even smaller now that I saw him head-on. I tried to maintain my composure, but my eyes slipped over that body which, though familiar, never ceased to captivate.

— I thought it would be a way to please you — he replied, with a half-smile that blended innocence and teasing.

I crossed my arms, still standing at the door, pretending to be indignant. Yet the truth was that a different spark had already extinguished most of the anger I had felt just moments before. It wasn't just his clumsy attempt, but the genuine effort he was putting forth, even without knowing precisely what he was doing.

— So now you intend to be my little housekeeper? — I teased, crossing my arms while trying to maintain a serious expression.

He merely chuckled, relaxed, as if nothing about the situation was out of the ordinary. Sweat glistened on his tanned skin, and the warm morning promised an even more sultry day ahead. The droplets trickled slowly down his face, highlighting the line of his jaw and the striking features that had always drawn me in.

— You're already all sweaty — I remarked, rolling my eyes. — Wipe that face, but don't use the dish towel!

He glanced around, searching for something to use, but found nothing. Then, without much thought, he brought the apron to his forehead and used it to dry himself. The simple, carefree gesture had an unexpected effect on me.

Beneath the fabric he lifted, that body I knew so well was revealed. My mouth slightly parted, almost unconsciously, as my eyes slid over the vision he had just unveiled. Below the apron hung the member that had filled and driven me wild countless times before. Even at rest, it was impressive — a blend of strength and softness, accompanied by well-kept contours that made the sight all the more mesmerizing. It was robust; even in repose, it held a fine stature, all covered in a light caramel tone with not a single hair in sight. There was no skin veiling the rosy glans that resembled a magnificent jewel adorning the shaft. It looked like a delectable fruit, ripe and inviting, begging to be picked by onlookers. His testicles framed his penis, harmoniously composing a beautiful masculine display.

I swallowed hard, attempting to mask the warmth flooding my face and the desire beginning to surge within me. My pride still wished to maintain a facade, but my heart and my skin were already leaning toward a different kind of reaction.

The dishes from the previous day rested organized in the drying rack, clean and shining, while the sink remained damp, a remnant of the recent chore. My gaze scanned each detail in an automatic inspection, and to my surprise, everything appeared in order. Nevertheless, commending him for something I regarded as a basic obligation was out of the question.

— Now, little housekeeper — I said, arching an eyebrow and adopting a deliberately teasing tone —, grab the mop and dry that wet sink; we don't want anything damp around here!

I crossed my arms once more, as if expecting him to comply with the orders, while a hint of amusement mingled with seriousness. After all, if he wished to redeem himself, he would not escape fulfilling the task to the end.

As he turned his back to me, my eyes were drawn to the natural movement of his body. His perfectly sculpted backside seemed to perform a dance with each step or gesture he made. The skin, subtly marked by the contours of his beachwear, revealed the precise boundaries where the sun had kissed his perfection. It was as if his body held the memory of warm days, free from any other marks besides these.

The way he leaned appeared to conspire against my sanity. Every movement of his muscles, every nonchalant gesture ignited something within me that I desperately tried to control. My gaze remained fixed, hypnotized, as the heat coursing through my body enveloped me like a feverish, dense embrace.

Between my thighs, desire pulsed, not merely a whim, but a hunger that spread, flooding me with waves of liquid warmth. I felt myself growing damp, surrendering to the want that began to bloom without permission. My legs pressed together, as if attempting to contain the solitary pleasure that was starting to awaken within, while my senses seemed intensified — each breath, each heartbeat, a new way of feeling.

My breasts hardened beneath the fabric that covered me, sensitive enough to seem to plead for a contact I dared not initiate. It was a sweet torment spiraling through my skin. I never imagined that something so mundane — him, mopping the sink — could lead me to this state of utter surrender to desire. Yet there I was, breathing deeply, desperately trying to maintain control while he transformed the ordinary into a spectacle capable of disarming me entirely.
