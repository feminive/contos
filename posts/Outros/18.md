Occasionally, we find ourselves unhappy, ensnared in draining relationships, yet we continue for the sake of convenience. I have never been one to embrace confrontation, and, at least, he seemed content. My boyfriend is a decent man, yet limited in his sexual approach, and he is not very open to dialogue. He takes offense whenever I attempt to express my desires, which only leaves me feeling frustrated. Countless ideas have crossed my mind, numerous possibilities to shatter the monotony, but he consistently opts for the easiest, quickest, and most predictable path.

Lately, a forbidden thought has taken residence in my mind: a blend of desire and vengeance. I longed to surrender myself to one of his friends. I yearned to dismantle the Christian reputation he held so dear. I craved the sensation of humiliation. The lack of being fulfilled as a woman ignited a furious tempest within me. And do not think he was not warned. During our last argument, I made it clear, without ambiguity, that if he did not assume the role of a man within our home, I would certainly seek that fulfillment among his friends. He was forewarned in every sense. And that was precisely when the threat materialized.

I had chosen a target; he was merely a regular acquaintance at my boyfriend’s house, yet on that day, I intended to strike with all my might. The dress was slightly shorter, my manner of crossing my legs on the sofa, and the lingering gaze, disguised as a casual jest. I knew precisely what I was doing.

His friend had always been the antithesis of my boyfriend: confident, with an easy smile that concealed something deeper, a spark of mischief I had never dared to explore… until now. It was almost unbearable how he moved through the room with such ease, as if he already understood the power he held over me. He had looked at me for some time, smiling unnecessarily, always curious about my intimacy.

The conversation flowed trivially among the three of us, while my boyfriend spoke, oblivious to the game unfolding right under his nose. My eyes met his in subtle moments — long enough to make the blood boil within me. When my boyfriend retreated to the kitchen, I seized the opportunity.

— Today, I’m going to use you, man? — My voice emerged low, like a secret wrested from my lips.

— Huh? Are you crazy? — The look of sheer astonishment was etched across his face.

With a countenance of surprise, he did not pull back. On the contrary, he drew closer, just enough for me to feel the warmth of his body.

— This is dangerous — he said, a smirk playing on his lips, his eyes flickering toward the door.

— I know, but I don’t care! — I replied, without a moment’s hesitation.

My hands trembled, but my resolve remained steadfast. It was a choice I knew I could not take back, yet, in that moment, the weight of the consequences felt trivial against the overwhelming desire to break the chains that bound me. When my boyfriend returned, everything seemed in place — except the excitement simmering within me, and the palpable tension between the two of us.

The tension only escalated! Every little gesture from him felt like a provocation: the way he held his glass, how he cast discreet glances my way, or the casual manner in which he touched me. I was consumed by this insane desire, yet with each passing second, it seemed increasingly impossible to retreat.

My cowardly boyfriend, unsure of how to react to the consummation of my threat before his very eyes, sought his keys, claiming he needed to buy something at the market.

— Just a minute, I won’t be long — he said, diverting his gaze, beads of sweat forming on his brow as he attempted to find a quick escape route, nearly in a panic.

— You will stay here; you will learn from him the proper way to treat a woman. If you walk out that door, do not return! — I was the epitome of fury before two astonished men, cursing loudly, my words resonating in dissonant tones.

Silently, the resigned man settled into a corner of the room, wearied by guilt, and then everything collapsed. The deafening silence made it seem as though we were in a minefield, where the slightest misstep could prove fatal.

— You shouldn’t joke like that — said the friend, his voice betraying the seriousness of his attempt to gauge whether this was all a jest.

I laughed in response, not from nervousness or humor, but with a boldness I had not known I possessed. I walked toward him slowly, unyielding, as if each step were meticulously calculated to convey the majesty of my femininity.

— And who said I’m joking? — I whispered, stopping close enough to feel his heavy breath as I traced my fingers along what he so proudly claimed was ample.

For a fleeting moment, I thought he might retreat. Perhaps he considered the friend who regarded him as a brother, the implications of this act, but I witnessed the precise instant he surrendered to his own desires. His gaze hardened, his hands rose to my waist, and in a swift motion, he pulled me toward him.

The kiss was overwhelming, as if we had been stifling this for an eternity. My head spun, not only from the intensity of the moment but from the exhilaration of finally choosing for myself. He explored my body with confidence, as if reclaiming something he had never possessed, yet now embraced freely.

There was no turning back! In that moment, not when the adrenaline mingled with desire consumed everything. He pressed me against the wall, his breath ragged against my neck, his lips traversing my skin as if discovering forbidden territory.

My elbows danced beneath the straps of my dress, exposing my bare breasts. The ambient temperature hardened my nipples and a visceral shiver coursed through me. His face collided against them with fervor, like a calf seeking its mother’s udder. The pain and pleasure of his wet suckling caused me to involuntarily part my lips. It felt as though his tongue danced upon a stage, igniting a small flame that flickered in the air, scorching my soul and igniting desire.

I learned what tranquility was when his firm hands glided recklessly over my curves, exploring every inch with the confidence of one who had envisioned this countless times. My skin seemed to ignite at his touch, and my breath grew labored, punctuated by the unrestrained sighs escaping me. Beneath my dress, my panties were torn away, and his hand invaded me with urgent fervor.

My body responded tumultuously to the first touch, a surge of emotions and sensations overwhelmed me, stripping me of the strength that held me up; he rubbed my sex mercilessly, spreading a wet sensation across my thighs. His fingers incited tremendous frenzy within me, and my mouth uttered a cacophony of incoherence.

— You little whore!

— Say it again!

— You whore, bitch!

— Then make me your whore!

With a jolt, I was thrown to the ground, kneeling before him as if I were a slave meant to please her master, and before me, he, my tormentor, unshackled himself, revealing a splendid member that made me sweat at a mere glance. Dominated by the hand that gripped my head forcefully, I opened my mouth to receive what was rightfully mine. He penetrated me, transforming my lips into a vast expanse; that firm flesh claimed the oral space, finding resistance only in my throat. A flow of saliva welled from the suffocation, its flavor smooth and warm. In the violence of the act, I found myself perpetually passive and his.

His cursed hand sliced through the air with a slap, followed by a spit upon my face, which was meant to humiliate me but instead brought forth tears of joy, my makeup running, wild with laughter, dirty and drooling, prostrated before him. The sting upon my face ignited a strange pleasure I had never known. I was pushed down by the soles of his feet to the ground, kicked like a dog.

— Get on all fours, woman!

I was invaded in such a way that it caused me profound pain from the heat that seized my vagina. I howled as my flesh was brutally filled, the texture felt clear, I could differentiate between the head and the body. The pain from my uterus urged me to escape immediately, yet I felt anchored, unable to comprehend why I awaited more, and even if I tried, I had already been tamed by him who held my hair.

The sound of our bodies colliding was deafening, the impact reverberated through my spine, and the waves spread to the base of my neck, rattling my thoughts and clouding my judgment. In screams, I cried out for him to stop, pleading for gentleness, tears pouring profusely from my eyes — yet, I still smiled.

The room seemed to vanish around us. There was no guilt, no future, only the present — the warmth of his member, the muffled moans, the escalating rhythm that united us in a manner I had never before experienced. It was both liberating and wicked, as though we were challenging not only the limits but also the rules that had hitherto imprisoned me.

Then, everything became blurred and confusing, the snapping sounds ceased when I felt a surge within me, everything became wet, and pleasure engulfed my soul, causing me to collapse, surrendered and unconscious of my existence. My torment ceased, and all that remained was the sound of heavy breathing and droplets of sweat cascading down my arched back. Lying face down, something flowed down my legs — my dignity.

But reality soon knocked at the door — quite literally. The sound of the key in the lock pulled me from that trance. The door of the house closed behind my boyfriend, who stood silently, witnessing everything unfold.

My head rested on the carpet, and in peace, I awaited my heart to beat steadily once more. Everything had concluded, and what had been discomforting took on meaning; emptied as I was, I felt undeniably filled. He gazed at me as if he wished to speak, yet no words were necessary — it was all there, in the intense gleam of his eyes.
