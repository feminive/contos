During my university days, my dearest friend was Claudia—oh, what a wonderfully eccentric girl she was! Always ready for parties and bars, she radiated contagious energy, with a stunning body and bright green eyes that beautifully contrasted with her tanned skin and curly hair.

She was my party companion; we would go out together and attract all the boys. Yet, I had never witnessed her with another girl; in fact, we had never broached the subject seriously. It was peculiar, considering our conversations covered everything else, but this topic remained untouched.

One day, a classmate invited our group over for drinks, and off we went, looking fabulous as ever! I wore my usual shorts while she looked ravishing in a green dress. That evening, we agreed that she would abstain from drinking since she would be my designated driver; we often took turns with that responsibility.

The gathering was quite enjoyable. She ended up with a boy while I entertained two, nothing much to write home about—just ordinary guys acting like peacocks, you know? Easily forgotten, yet I must confess that the second one was rather appealing.

Around two in the morning, the party came to an end, and we chatted in the car about the night, sharing gossip and recounting the boys we had kissed. I was a bit tipsy and lamenting not bringing my second flirt home, complaining that I would end the night alone. Claudia, who was sober, laughed heartily with that enchanting smile of hers.

We arrived, and as the car rolled into my building's garage, preparing to exit, we burst into giggles when the garage light suddenly went out! I know it’s not truly funny, but we found amusement in it. However, our laughter was abruptly interrupted by an uncomfortable silence, and I noticed her deep in thought. I brushed it off, assuming her sobriety was the reason for her quietness; I can be quite the annoying drunk, you see! So, I began to chatter loudly in the car about wanting to kiss someone. To my surprise, she spoke with a slightly strained voice:

"Kiss me!"

Thinking she was joking, I leaned in for a playful peck, but she grabbed my face with both hands and pulled me in for a real kiss, not just a peck. The warmth of her lips and the flavor of her mouth ignited something intensely within me; I thought, "What on earth is happening?" There was no guilt; I surrendered completely.

The kisses grew more fervent; my lips traveled to her neck as my hands explored her body. She adjusted in her seat, slightly parting her legs, guiding my hand to her inner thigh. Understanding her intent, I wasted no time and swiftly removed her panties. I hadn’t realized that one of my breasts had already slipped out of my blouse until I felt a gentle push backward, and her mouth was immediately on my nipple. With her first lick, my soul almost escaped my body through my breast; her hand sought the other breast, alternating between them, squeezing, licking, and sucking in a manner that drove me wild with desire.

Our passionate encounter resembled a fierce struggle, two assertive women seeking to bring each other pleasure. Two pairs of bare breasts pressed together, our bodies glistening with sweat, the taste of salt enveloping us. My hand found its way between her legs, discovering the warmth of her wetness, while my shorts and panties lay discarded on the car floor. She reclined my passenger seat, spreading my legs wide, and without any foreplay, dove straight to my clitoris. I felt her warm mouth, her wet tongue licking me, and at that moment, my body arched backward entirely, waves of pleasure crashing over me, causing me to tremble, writhe, and grip my breast tightly while tugging at her hair. Her fingers invaded me—how many, I couldn’t say—but they found the exact spots, surgical in their precision.

I climaxed, forcefully and intensely. My moan erupted as a muffled scream in the silence of the parking lot.

I grasped her shoulders tightly, pulling her down to where I lay, a clumsy maneuver in the cramped car as we bumped against everything. I opened her legs, tracing my fingers along her luscious lips, feeling the moisture, teasing the inner folds, growing more aroused as I watched her breath quicken, her body subtly contorting, her face reflecting pure ecstasy. I caressed her intensely, alternating between firmness and gentleness, until her eyes opened wide, exposing the whites, her face trembling, her mouth barely forming coherent words.

"Go! Just like that! Faster..."

The car windows fogged up, and the darkness of the parking lot ensured that no one could witness the fervor unfolding within. Inside the vehicle, I delighted in her, riding her until I felt her tremble beneath me. She squirmed, turning shyly to the side, withdrawing her finger that had been firmly pressed against my anus.

There we remained, kissing and caressing each other softly, gently exploring each other's breasts and intimate areas for several minutes until our fire began to subside. We dressed and took the elevator up to my apartment.

That was our first experience together, and there have been many more since. If you wish, I could share a few more tales.
