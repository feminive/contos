I worked in a bustling café situated in the vibrant beachfront area of the city, a prestigious locale that overflowed with energy at night, drawing in beautiful and lively patrons. It felt like a scene from a film: constant smiles, sun-kissed skin, and colorful drinks that sparkled under the soft lights. The atmosphere was a sanctuary of charm and character, adorned with intricate decor — trinkets from every corner of the globe, gifts from customers who had etched their memories into this place.

Behind the counter, we, the staff, moved in a frenetic rhythm, squeezed into the limited space we had, yet always striving to serve everyone with warmth and efficiency. The hustle and bustle were part of the enchantment of that place, where each evening was a blend of chaos and magic. I, however, had always been more reserved, with a shy smile and a transparency I could never quite hide. My eyes betrayed me before I even realized it, and the blush on my cheeks revealed every feeling. I fell into this state whenever I saw him.

He was tall, a god with short curly hair and a roguish face adorned with stubble; his physique was toned, with muscular arms and strong hands — he could have any woman he desired. Everyone around him adored him; he was charming and helpful, a little bit of a flirt. And I, poor woman, lived with the certainty that he would only ever exist in my dreams; he was still married.

Tighter than the bar was the stockroom corridor, a chaotic and dimly lit space filled with stacked boxes and crates strewn across the floor, where only one person could pass at a time. If two tried, they would have to squeeze themselves together. By courtesy, the norm was to wait for the other person to cross before proceeding, but when it was him… I could not resist. I grasped at any opportunity to share that small space with him.

— You know you have to wait, right? Two people can’t pass here. — He complained with a tone of mock indignation, almost like he was joking.

— Oh, I’m so forgetful! I always overlook that…

We stood there, somewhat stuck, attempting to calculate how to navigate together. My face burned with embarrassment and excitement, while I struggled to contain the smile that insisted on surfacing. My entire body seemed to scream, betraying how much that moment affected me. He, ever the gentleman, did his best to avoid contact, turning his face or pressing himself against the boxes, but that only heightened the allure.

The tightness of our bodies quickened my breath, and I felt the pressure of my chest against his firmness. His heavy hand rested on my waist, guiding me through the narrow space, and in that instant, everything around us faded away. Our gazes locked, conspiratorial, laden with a sweet tension that enveloped us like a secret.

The warmth of his breath brushed against my face, causing my skin to tingle. My heart raced, and my eyes nearly fluttered shut, surrendering to the fantasy of a kiss that felt so close, so inevitable. It was as if the entire world conspired to prolong that moment, an eternity compressed into a few seconds. The world around us seemed muted, as if everything had paused just for us. The thick silence, almost tangible, was broken by his deep, nearby voice:

— At this rate, I might lose my mind.

Those words pierced my skin like fire, each syllable infused with an intensity that completely melted me. His presence, his warmth, his proximity… everything made me lose all control. I needed to respond, to say something, but my mind was a whirlwind, words slipping away from me.

Perhaps I murmured something — I do not even know what — but it was my smile that spoke for me. A rare smile, one of a wanton woman, the kind that almost no one could draw from me. It emerged effortlessly, as if my soul had surrendered in that moment. And then, I simply smiled, allowing everything I felt to shine through. He knew that at that moment I was his, and he could claim me right there, but there were eyes around; it was merely a common passage; it should happen later.

I slipped into the stockroom, striving to regain my composure. His scent lingered on my clothes, and the smile remained alive in my eyes, while my body still held the memory of his awakened presence from our contact. I craved another moment alone with him, but he was married! I could never muster the courage to invite him to my home, and so I resigned myself to the thought that that moment would be unique and would never happen again.

It was late, the café had closed, and the last customers settled their tabs. The serving team prepared to end their shift; he could have already left, but he chose to stay and help, something he often did. The thought of him wanting to linger until the end to approach me again stirred my anxiety. Was that really the case?

The lights dimmed, leaving only a soft glow in the café, as a colleague said her goodbyes while I busied myself closing the register. He walked her to the door, engaged in an endless conversation, while I sweated with excitement and nerves. “_Would I give myself to him right there?_” If my thoughts materialized, it would be the most outrageous thing of my life! A sudden wave of embarrassment washed over me as I remembered I was not prepared, having spent the entire day in those clothes, and I dashed to the staff restroom at the back of the establishment, desperate to check my appearance.

When I felt satisfied, I heard his voice calling me like a whisper from outside.

— Where are you? — his voice came from the stockroom.

— Here — I shouted, making my way towards him, feeling my way through the dimness.

His accent was a sweet poison, a chalice to which I surrendered with insatiable thirst; each word was a promise of temptation. I followed his voice as if entranced by a hypnotic melody until I found him, a shadow waiting beneath the pale light of a solitary lamp. There was something profane in that smile — a demon clad in flesh, a promise of my sin and downfall.

No words were necessary. Our bodies collided in a primitive urgency, the sharp sound of our closeness shattering the silence. The kiss was a wet clash, our tongues dueling as if seeking territory, desire, and dominion. His hands, restless and untamed, roamed my skin as if charting a map, and I, vulnerable and surrendered, opened myself to his touches, welcoming each invasion with rising fervor.

The air around us was thick, nearly palpable, the heat transforming our bodies into slick surfaces of sweat. Each breath was a struggle to find oxygen as the world faded away, leaving only sin, desire, and the sweet hell we were creating together.

In a sudden movement, he turned me around, the strength of his actions evoking a mix of fear and longing. His presence was a silent promise, threatening and pulsating. My lips, dry, trembled with anticipation. In an automatic gesture, I lifted my skirt, and the rigid warmth of his being met my skin like a brand. A moan escaped me as the last veil guarding my honor was rudely stripped away, gliding against my skin with calculated precision.

I trembled, waiting for the moment when he would invade me, leading me to the ecstasy that only the madness of desire can provide. But he was cruel, wielding his member like a tool of torture, dragging it against me in slow, teasing motions. Desperate, I pressed my body against his, a silent plea for more, but his firm arms kept me captive, enforcing a rhythm that made our skins meet in the most hidden recesses, like a fire devouring without haste.

He held me captive, his strong hands gripping my breasts in a pressure that oscillated between pain and pleasure. Waves of shock coursed through my thighs, reverberating down to my core, which pulsed in desperation, releasing an indecent dampness. The wait was torturous, and each second stretched into eternity. My voice, choked with longing, implored:

— Please, take me…

And he was merciful. But even when I was ready, the impact overwhelmed me. In a single, precise movement, I felt my flesh yield to something warm, thick, and unmistakably vulgar. He invaded me as if reclaiming territory, pulling the air from my lungs and forcing tears to spill, scalding my skin. I was filled completely, every fiber of my being adjusting to the presence of that man who had haunted my fantasies for so many nights.

A hoarse, primal cry escaped my lips, echoing in the void around us as the heat of his texture consumed me. I was his, and in that moment, nothing else existed in the world but the two of us, intertwined in a dance of desire and surrender.

Within me, he made me reborn. Each thrust was a precise blow, merciless, ripping from me unrestrained screams that resonated throughout the empty space surrounding us. My body, overtaken by spasms, arched in complete submission. The pleasure and pain intertwined in my trembling smile as I felt the raw, overwhelming bliss of that man claiming me entirely.

I wanted him deeper, wanted him to become part of me. My body pushed against his, seeking to feel him in every fiber of my being, yearning for him to fill me to the brim. My belly throbbed, longing for him, while our bodies danced in an unsteady yet visceral rhythm.

The climax arrived like a storm. My body shook, contracted in uncontrollable spasms as I exploded into a hoarse, primal scream, my nails digging into his skin in an attempt to anchor myself to reality. My core closed around him, drawing him in, silently begging that he would not stop, as my world crumbled into waves of pleasure that seemed infinite.

He followed soon after, his entire body tense like a string about to snap. A deep, guttural sound escaped his lips as he filled me with his warmth, each surge of his pleasure flooding me and sealing the bond we shared in that instant. Our bodies collapsed together, sweaty and breathless, marked by the ecstasy we had just experienced.

For a few moments, silence reigned, broken only by our heavy breaths. He remained inside me, as if that moment were eternal, our skins still glued together by sweat. Finally, he slipped away, leaving a void that made me tremble once more. Over my curves, the evidence of our animalistic behavior trickled down, warm and viscous. I felt embarrassed by the sensation.

We lay side by side, staring at the empty ceiling as if contemplating infinity. His hand found mine, and for a brief moment, I felt that desire had given way to something deeper, something that perhaps was even more dangerous than the pleasure we had just shared.
