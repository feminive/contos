I now find myself a single woman, and upon embracing this status, many men I knew waited for the mourning period of my recent breakup to approach me under the guise of concern. They behaved as if I were not a singular entity, incessantly offering the same tiresome platitudes, regurgitating advice on matters I had already moved beyond. My sorrow was not born from the end of the relationship but from the solitude that resided within me.

Many sought to court me, yet among them, one captured my attention: the fiancé of a friend, who reached out to me via phone.

— I will come over today to see how you are doing.

I recall the firmness in his voice as he uttered those words. He did not ask; he merely announced his intentions. I had no real business with him, especially in the absence of my friend. “_Should I inform her of his visit?_” I pondered. Of course, I understood what this was about; I knew that this scoundrel would attempt something the moment he arrived. Yet I was worse. I craved this encounter, and he would be the one to provide it. I remained silent.

I welcomed him into my apartment. The drawn curtains cast a dim light, concealing the absence of certain furniture and the scattered picture frames devoid of photographs. I wore nothing special for him; my attire was that of a languid Saturday afternoon, chosen for solitude away from prying eyes. Today, I would allow him to see, if he could, beyond my sorrow, the form of my body.

— Come in.

He stepped inside and positioned himself in the center of the room, gazing at me. I said nothing, for I had no words to exchange with him. He stumbled through trivial chatter, and I remained mute, merely listening as I awaited his silence. When it did not come, I pulled my blouse over my head, allowing the cool air to brush against my breasts, revealing the bare skin he longed to see.

— Touch.

I prayed that his touch on my now hardened nipples would not be entirely unpleasant; I needed a man who could satisfy my desires. Tentatively, he approached, leaning against me, and a soft kiss graced my lips—though I craved intensity. To clarify how things would unfold, I extricated myself from his grasp and unbuttoned his trousers, locking eyes with him. His mouth fell open in surprise, and his eyes widened as his trousers pooled at his feet. I pushed him onto the sofa and stripped completely; I felt no shame in my unpreparedness, my unkempt pubic hair a testament to my neglect of self-care.

— Sit.

He collapsed onto the sofa, frantic, hastily shedding his clothes, as if he believed what I was offering would be fleeting—I had much more to give. I claimed my place beside him, indulging in his warmth, kissing his eager mouth, and exploring his member, which remained unready. I freed myself from his lips, attacking his neck, biting and licking down to his earlobes. His member grew warm and firm, delighting me with its size. I descended to his nipples, sucking and eliciting soft moans of pleasure; one by one, I lavished attention on them, leaving them marked and reddened. Satisfied with his arousal, I took his penis into my mouth, as if punishing myself, provoking a gag reflex, saliva cascading down his shaft, easing the glide of my hands as they felt his warm, rigid flesh pulse beneath my fingers.

The bitter taste and heated skin filled my lips, sending waves of intense pleasure coursing through me as I coated my face with the fluids that flowed forth, akin to a child delighting in a mess. With firm movements, I sucked him deep, twisting my lips around his head with such fervor that I felt him tremble beneath my touch. My body was sensitive, my skin electrified, breaths growing heavier with each passing moment. When my skin brushed against his, I shivered; his masculine form was what I yearned to feel inside me, to make me whole. Yet I was not entirely prepared to receive him.

I rose above him, still seated on the sofa, presenting my core to his face, forcing my wet sex against him. I pressed against him, craving the taste of his tongue; his clumsy fingers penetrated me in every conceivable way, and I only wished to suffocate him with my desire. The scent of my arousal clung to his face like a perfume that would be difficult to wash away. I rode his mouth, dominating his face in a frenzied pursuit of pleasure that I doubted he could provide. His tongue wandered through my depths, from my rear to my entrance, and I felt myself losing control, now determined to fulfill my craving.

I let myself slide, grinding against his body until I felt the tip of his penis intruding upon my sanctuary. With a deliberate motion, I allowed myself to be enveloped in one swift motion. I savored every inch, the heat of his shaft, the rigidity that filled me completely. I pushed to the point where my clitoris pressed against his abdomen, and I was overwhelmed by exquisite pain that I never wished to escape.

I refused to let him take control; I grasped his hair, using it as reins, and captured his lips with mine. Like a bitch in heat, I unleashed my energy upon that man, who betrayed my friend alongside me. I felt him deep within, pleasure radiating from my core to the tips of my fingers, my body becoming increasingly relaxed. Over him, I climaxed, not ceasing my movements until I was paralyzed by the orgasm that left my body trembling, folding forward in a state of utter exhaustion. Within me, a warm, white, viscous river flowed, signifying that he had released himself.

— Please, get dressed and leave — I said, still naked, heading toward the bathroom.

— But... — he attempted to speak, but I quickly silenced him.

— I do not wish to converse; just go.

When I returned to the living room, only the lingering scent of our union remained in the air; the warmth of our bodies could still be felt on the sofa cushion. What transpired here would never happen again, nor would anyone ever know.
