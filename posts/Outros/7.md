Have you ever woken up one day completely consumed by desire? That day was like this for me; I awoke and jumped into the shower, brushing myself three times in quick succession, and nothing could quell the fire within. It was a socially dead day for me; I had no money to go out, yet I yearned for a kiss! I scrolled through my contacts, reaching out to a few, but some were unavailable, while others showed little interest. I felt despondent and simply resigned myself to the situation. I am not a nymphomaniac; I merely had an overwhelming craving and sought a connection, be it with a man or a woman.

In my neighborhood, there is a younger boy who often bothers me. He is one of those boys who loves to show off to his friends, and I doubt he would know what to do with a real woman if he ever met one. He is cute, I must admit, but far too young for my taste. I had considered sneaking a few kisses with him, but I feared he would boast to everyone. Yet, no one would believe him, and his sister, a friend of mine, has mentioned that he has been talking about me. Ah, boys...

It was nearing lunchtime when I dressed and hurried to the bakery, hoping to find some fresh bread. I wore comfortable home attire: a worn-out pair of shorts and a top that would reveal the outline of my breasts with the slightest breeze. I dashed down the street, and there he was, washing his father's car. The little man always stirred something within me, and I despised it. He caught sight of me.

"Hey! Where are you off to?" he exclaimed, chuckling, hose in hand.

Normally, I would have ignored him, but today I was ready for a fight. I crossed the street, walking toward him, and his expression shifted to one of fear as I approached.

"Did you speak to me, boy?" I asked, my face stern.

"Hey, what's up, gorgeous?" he replied awkwardly, trying to maintain his cool.

"Gorgeous?" I shot back, annoyed and confused! "Since when do I give you the right to address me like that?"

The street was deserted, the car partially shielding us; if I were to slap him, no one would notice, but I did something far worse. I grabbed his bulge, squeezing it.

"Ouch!" he yelped in pain.

"Go on, serenade me now! My hand's on your manhood—sing for me, or have you gone mute?"

He merely tried to pull away; I had crossed a line, and he knew he couldn't retaliate. I acted on impulse and immediately regretted my actions. I knew trouble was on the horizon. I released his member, and from what I felt, he was well-endowed!

"Those pick-up lines are extremely unpleasant, you know?"

And I began to unleash a barrage of reprimands. I was venting all my frustrations on him, poor kid. I left him dejected and went to buy my bread, returning home. The memory of his size lingered in my mind. It was a shame he was so young; I confess I had desired him.

The day dragged on, filled with tedium, nothing to do, nothing on TV, and before I knew it, the doorbell rang. It was him! I felt a pang of guilt for what I had done, worried he had told his parents. The boy stood at my door, freshly showered, and I had no idea why. I opened the door to find him with a pleading expression.

"Hi, can I talk to you?"

"Of course, come in!" I replied. "_What the hell did I just invite him for?_" I thought.

He stepped inside, scanning the room as if searching for something, gathering courage to say something...

"You know, I wanted to apologize for earlier." he said earnestly.

"That's alright, sweetheart; I’m sorry too, okay?" I said, embracing him warmly.

Oh dear friends, I had been feeling frisky all day, and when I felt his body in that hug, my body responded. Something within me ignited... I am quite the vixen, you have no idea.

"Did I hurt you, sweetie? I must be about four or five years older than him, but at our ages, that difference felt much larger."

"A little," he replied bashfully...

I placed my hand over his bulge again, caressing it, and spoke in a playful tone.

"Poor thing, my goodness, would you like a kiss to make it better?"

At that moment, I felt him stiffen, and under my touch, his member began to swell as I pressed. His expression was a mix of fear and surprise. I must have appeared like a wicked temptress, grinning and teasing him with my words.

"Are you not going to answer me? Has a cat got your tongue?" I tormented him into speaking.

"I want to," he stammered.

"Are you a virgin, boy?"

"No," he lied outright.

"Don't lie to me; tell the truth!"

"Yes, I am."

"Very good; you will please me and do everything I say, alright?"

He couldn't believe it, nor could I, honestly; this was not typical of me, and I felt like a stranger in my own skin, but that game drove me wild with desire. I left him standing there and took a seat on the couch, he following my every move with wide eyes and silence.

"Stand right here in front of me, kid," I commanded, and he complied, standing awkwardly, unsure where to place his hands.

I examined him from head to toe, like someone assessing a dish they were about to savor. He was slight but had the build of a man. He looked utterly embarrassed, trying to hide his arousal beneath his clothes.

"Do you know how to give oral, boy? Of course not, right?" I teased.

In one swift motion, I removed my shorts and panties, exposing myself fully to him, granting him a view he would never forget. His eyes widened, but he remained frozen in fear.

"Kneel here," I instructed.

As he drew closer, I grabbed him by the hair and, with a fierce look, commanded,

"Suck me!"

He was unsure where to begin, and I pushed his face against my core. He started with a timid flick of his tongue...

"Suck it, damn it, lick that thing! Are you disgusted by a woman's body, boy?" I pressed, shoving his face harder against me, using both hands.

At that point, he improved somewhat; my eyes rolled back in pleasure. He wasn’t skilled, but the situation fueled my arousal, compensating for his lack of experience. As he became bolder, he attempted to grab my breasts, and I slapped his hand away!

"No, I didn’t tell you to do that; take your hand off me!"

I wanted to dominate him, to mold him into my little lamb. He lacked what I needed to reach climax, and I craved something more. I pushed him away...

"Take off your clothes; let me see that cock. Is it clean?"

"Yes..." he said as he stripped completely.

The lad had potential; he wasn’t huge but was attractive, with a decent thickness and a pretty head. I pulled him closer as I adjusted myself comfortably in the armchair, giving a sniff to ensure he was clean. Just from the touch, I felt him shudder.

"Are you already ready to cum, boy?" I inquired, laughing. "Are you that weak?"

I gave him a solid blow job, and he began to moan. I knew he was on the brink and gripped his testicles firmly to see if he could hold back a bit longer. Internally, I was in stitches, reveling in the situation; he trembled with nervousness, and even the slightest movement I made on him caused him to tense up, fighting off an orgasm. I knew he couldn’t hold on, but this was about my fantasy—a mix of lust and amusement. "Now he’s going to lose it," I thought. I released him, turning my back and positioning myself on all fours on the chair, spread open as if it were physically impossible to be more exposed; I was sure he could see everything if he wanted.

"Fuck me, start slow, and when I say so, you can pound me hard and fast," I commanded, though inside I wanted to burst out laughing. I had wagered with myself that he wouldn’t last past the twentieth thrust.

"Do you want to eat my ass or my pussy?" I asked innocently; I had no intention of offering him my backside. I merely wanted to see him squirm.

"Ass..."

"And do you even know how to eat ass, you fool? But you can’t even hold back with a blow job! Come on, get ready... place it in front, understood?"

I simply wanted to be wicked. I grabbed his cock between my legs and started grinding to accommodate him inside me. It felt delightful as he entered; I was wet and ready. The sensation of being filled completely was exquisite.

"Grab my waist, go on." I commanded. "Now thrust, I said," keeping my hand on his thigh to ensure he maintained a distance so I wouldn’t be impaled.

He did what he could; his cock was pleasant, velvety, and of good girth, and soon a delightful warmth washed over me. I could have even climaxed, but his rhythm was erratic and awkward, poor thing. The boy had wanted to cum half an hour ago, but I wasn’t allowing it.

"Thrust harder, damn it, thrust like a man!" I said, my tone filled with frustration.

He began to thrust with a newfound vigor, trying to prove himself. I started to laugh at him, and the more I laughed, the harder he tried. It hurt a little, but the pleasure was undeniable. Before long, I felt something warm trickling inside me. I was laughing inside, thinking I would play a trick and pretend I was about to climax...

"Don’t stop, don’t stop, thrust fast and hard."

The boy had no energy left; my pussy felt like a cocktail shaker filled with cum, and I sensed him flaccid within me. I grew tired of the game... When I stood up, everything dripped down my legs, and the boy looked at me with a face that screamed, "What have I done?" I scowled and fixed my gaze on him.

"Get dressed and leave. And when I call you again, you better wash that cock and come running," I commanded my little plaything.

He dressed quickly, and before stepping out the door, he asked me a question:

"Was it good? Did you enjoy it?" he said, his little face so endearing...

"Of course not, you coward; you couldn’t handle one thrust! Get out of here," I shouted, ordering him to leave.

As the door closed, I burst into laughter, unable to stop! Yet, truth be told, I had enjoyed him. I pondered the possibility of training him to do things my way. I went to clean up, but first, I had to finish the job he had left undone! And that was that. I will share one or two more stories with him in the future. Stay tuned for the next episode.
