It was night, and the road wound its way through a silent and mysterious landscape. The car, with headlights slicing through the darkness, glided smoothly along the asphalt, illuminating only what was necessary to forge ahead. Inside, I drove with focus, my hands firmly gripping the wheel. The faint glow of the dashboard flickered, hinting that it was time to seek a gas station for a refill. The continuous hum of the engine, coupled with the rustling of trees in the night breeze, created an almost hypnotic soundtrack, making it difficult to keep my eyes open. Yet, the stars dotted the sky above, witnessing my solitude and bringing a comforting sensation as I continued, drowsy yet serene, lost in profound thoughts.

Suddenly, a patch of absolute darkness swallowed the road. The silence seemed to amplify, and everything around me plunged into an even denser obscurity. Then, almost as if by magic, the sky erupted into a spectacle of lights. A sea of stars shimmered with an intensity never before seen, as if the cosmos had decided to put on a show solely for me. It was such a breathtaking scene that my heart began to race.

Even knowing the dangers of the road, an irresistible impulse seized me. I pulled over to the shoulder, turned off the engine, and stepped out of the car. The silence now was profound, pierced only by the echo of my own movement. Beneath that sky, with stars sparkling like jewels against the dark mantle of the universe, I stood still, soaking in the moment. It was a unique connection between earth and infinity, something I knew I would never forget.

Suddenly, the spectacle came to life even more. Shooting stars began to streak across the sky, one after another, leaving luminous trails in their wake. But one of them captured my attention. Its glow was different, a vibrant emerald green, and it seemed to possess a life of its own. It grew and danced, as if eager to traverse the sky faster than the others. When I realized it was heading in my direction, a chill ran down my spine.

I was frozen, bewildered, watching what seemed impossible. The shining object approached with an intense and frantic motion until reason kicked in, prompting me to sprint back to the car. I slammed the door and watched through the window as that mysterious, almost magical light passed over me, leaving a trail of fascination and dread.

Could it have all been a dream, perhaps? Now I found myself lying naked on what appeared to be a hospital bed. I was tethered to machines, surrounded by monotonous sounds, like the beeping of monitors. Had I been struck by a truck going the wrong way? Or perhaps by a meteorite falling from the sky?

My body felt numb, as if submerged in a bath of anesthesia. The sensation was strange, almost relaxing, as if a wave of warm pleasure enveloped me. Surely, they had given me some potent medication, I thought, trying to maintain my focus. But then, I noticed something disturbing: there was a probe inside me, lodged within my vagina. It was large, made of something that resembled rubber. Each time I contracted, I felt the tube move, yielding to the pressure. Why would they put this inside me?

My breasts were covered by something soft, enveloped in warm shells that seemed to be made of suede. The touch was pleasant, yet undeniably strange. Some new medical technology? I wondered.

My eyes barely functioned. Everything was blurred, tall shadows moving around me, indistinct figures passing swiftly without responding to my attempts to call for help. They must be busy doctors, I tried to convince myself. But something felt amiss. These beings seemed... too tall, and their movements were not quite human.

I attempted to rationalize. It must be the burn unit. Perhaps they had put on masks or special suits for safety. I must be very drugged, confused by the medications. That had to be it.

But the more I clung to this notion, the more strange details emerged. The environment was illuminated by an eerie blue glow that did not seem to emanate from conventional lights. The air held a metallic scent, almost like ozone, and the sounds around me were low yet peculiar—like whispers in a language I could not comprehend.

I breathed deeply, trying to contain the wave of panic threatening to engulf me. I cannot lose my composure now. It’s just a hospital. It must be. The alternative was unthinkable.

Amid the rising panic, something unexpected occurred. The tubes connecting me began to move with a life of their own, pulling me from that environment and dragging me to a higher place.

A scream escaped my throat, but there was no echo in response. I was upside down, suspended somewhere I could not comprehend. This was not normal. Then began something I would never forget for the rest of my life. The tubes supporting me positioned my body in a star shape in the air. I felt as if warm tentacles coiled around my legs to support me, their movements almost peristaltic, massaging my thighs, flooding my body with a very strange energy. It was as if static coursed through my nervous system, leaving me relaxed.

A tear slipped from my eye. Somehow, I felt violated. That slow, persistent pleasure rising through my legs was not natural. I wanted to cry, but the soft ecstasy bubbling up my limbs would not allow it. When the rubber tube inside me began to inflate, I lost it. I felt as though all my inner walls had been touched at once, and it pulsated in perfect vibrational motions, sending small shockwaves through me. I wanted to protest, but every time I tried, a new wave drowned out my voice. Each attempt to make a sound was stifled.

My breathing grew increasingly labored, the air too light to inhale normally, and I had to exert effort. Meanwhile, on my breasts, those strange shells exhibited a fierce sucking motion, and I cannot deny it was delightful to be drawn into them. They seemed to read my thoughts, adjusting to the optimal position whenever I reacted positively. It was not like a mouth that could only focus on one point at a time. This thing encompassed an entire breast. When an intrusive thought crossed my mind: “Wouldn't it be nice to have one of those on my clitoris?” Instantly, something slithered like a warm snake down my groin, wetly touching my clitoris. It was strange, the thing inflating inside me, electrifying, and now something mimicking a perfect mouth.

That entity consuming me seemed intent on learning the behavior of my body. Whenever I felt discomfort, it adjusted to please me. If I thought of any sexual position, it would turn me, and with its tubes and tentacles, compel me to assume that form. I must be on all fours now. I was scared, but I could not stop thinking about sex. The inflated tube filling me was now shrinking, taking on a more familiar masculine shape, my body accommodating its rigidity. That thing seemed to be penetrating me with perfect rhythm. I knew I would go insane soon if this did not end; my body could not endure such pleasure for much longer.

And as that thing seemed to know all my desires, an explosion of serotonin and dopamine, in a cosmic embrace, poured cascades of euphoria over the deepest corners of my mind. My body became a field of pure energy, where every cell vibrated as if touched by an invisible symphony. I felt my blood flowing hot, and my lungs filled with an intoxicating air, fueled by the chemistry of the moment. My heart stopped beating for a few seconds, and my sense of time vanished. A second stretched as if it were infinite, and my entire being dissolved into waves of pure ecstasy. There were no more limits, only the sensation of being part of the universe, where pleasure transcended the physical and transformed into light, color, and living poetry.

I awoke lying on the hood of my car still on that empty highway, confused, contracting my vagina in search of signs of sex, but everything was fine; I had merely dreamed. I looked around for people and found none. I sat back in the driver’s seat and resumed my journey; I urgently needed some remedy for the discomfort I felt, something I had eaten had left my belly swollen and hard.
