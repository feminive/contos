Some ethereal relationships touch us more profoundly than those lived under the weight of reality. Not everything in this world must be tangible. When I first met her, I had never inhaled the scent or felt the warmth of her skin; her face was merely a tiny avatar on my phone screen. Yet, together, through words and images, we sculpted an entire universe of desire and surrender. It flowed beyond the limitations of the body: intense, immaterial, and yet devastatingly intimate.

She appeared like a comet crossing my orbit—a surprise notification, a shy response to a story on Instagram. Curiosity led me to reply, and from that moment, something began that I had no idea would become a tempest. At first glance, she was an ordinary girl: 23 years old, balancing studies and work, but there was something in her words, in the hesitant way she revealed parts of herself, that captivated me. When she confided, almost as a secret, that she had never lain with anyone—neither man nor woman—I felt a spark of desire and curiosity pierce through me.

It was not innocence she carried, but a hunger. She was a woman complete—beautiful, with a steady gaze and occasional laughter that seemed to hide secrets. There was something magnetic about her independence, yet also a vulnerability that made me want to dive into her depths. At a distance, our conversations evolved into something more. Initially, it was curiosity; then came the hotter words, the fantasies exchanged in messages that grew longer, later into the night.

There, miles apart, our exchanged words became the only bridge between our bodies. She undressed in language, and I did the same, until we were two naked souls, surrendered to the fiery idea of each other. The chair I sat in transformed into an altar; my body was the offering, and she, the devotee who worshiped it with adoration in every phrase. Her words held a hypnotic power, shaping my thoughts and solidifying sensations. Her touch became real, the warmth of skin, the shiver provoked by imagination, and the dampness that revealed the desire flowing without barriers.

I was bare, my legs crossed in a gesture of precarious restraint, as my hands oscillated between holding the phone and exploring my own body. Her command reached me like a whisper directly to my ear, her imagined tongue dancing in my mouth with an intensity so vivid that my breath became a tangle. Her absent presence echoed on my skin; I felt the weight of her hands, the strength of her fingers seemingly gripping my thighs and claiming my breasts.

When the mouth she described descended to envelop my nipple, it was as if my soul had been wrenched in a sudden ecstasy. I melted with the image, each of her words becoming a flame that burned slow and deliciously. It was bold, daring, ravenous, and I was wholly surrendered to her, body and mind.

I attempted to respond, to translate into words what I felt, but soon gave up. Every touch of mine was an extension of her commands, each muffled moan of mine an invocation to what she made me feel. I was at the mercy of a presence that had never touched my body, yet somehow felt more real than any other.

With my legs arched, awaiting touches that would not come, I rendered myself receptive to a desire that consumed me alone. I felt myself flow, liquid, through the most intimate parts of my body, the moisture that should have been savored by her tracing paths along the seat that supported me. It was hot, feverish; the lightest touch upon my greatest point of pleasure was like a spark igniting every nerve, threatening to shorten that ecstasy. The orgasm, eager, awaited my permission to be born, teetering on the precipice that my hand held with firmness and hesitation.

My fingers, resolute, sought the eternal darkness of my own depths, revealing once again the secrets of my own textures. I filled myself, explored myself, indulged as if lost in the most intimate abandonment. The world around me vanished; only the muffled sound of my ragged breathing remained, the unmistakable scent of my sex wafting through the air, enveloping my senses and intoxicating me. The salty taste of my own body emerged on my lips, brought forth by my insatiable tongue, while the unrestrained desire for her mouth to touch my most sacred spots pulsed in every cell.

— Lick me, suck me, devour me! — was the awkward plea she understood, torn from me in a poorly constructed sentence but laden with the urgency of desire. With each word, I imagined her there, consuming me, filling the void where my hands now ruled alone. It was her I wanted; it was she who needed to save me from the hunger I had created myself.

Her commands guided me to the end, like a leaf in the wind, lost and surrendered, until I was struck with force and dragged furiously to the ground. The impact felt like an electric shock, a pain that was not pain but the supreme tension that seized my entire body, tautening every muscle relentlessly. I wanted to scream, to release the cry rising from my soul, but the dominion over my body was no longer mine. The sound caught in my throat, a long, silent scream of agony and ecstasy that echoed in the stillness of the empty house.

My entire body trembled, a spasm that left me fragile, and I curled to the side, seeking comfort in myself, alone. My hand, once an instrument of pleasure, was now coated with the warm liquid of my own release, the proof of final surrender to desire. It was the uncontrollable rush of my body, the announcement that our exchange of messages had reached its climax.

I had climaxed for her. More than that, I had been hers—body, mind, and soul. Each of her words had sculpted the pleasure that erupted within me, and now, as I surrendered to exhaustion, I was satiated. A profound and intimate happiness filled the space around me, a silent gratitude for having had her, even if only at the fringes of the real.
