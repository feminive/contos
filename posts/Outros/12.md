I found myself at a bar, sharing a drink with a friend who was animatedly showcasing the women he had been messaging on Tinder. To be honest, I was utterly uninterested in his tales, and I had probably heard about at least thirty different girls he claimed to desire. Out of camaraderie, I feigned attention, offering a few cursory remarks. One woman he revealed caught me off guard; she was none other than my neighbor from the house behind us. Residing on the second floor, she often peered over to watch us enjoy our poolside moments, uninvited. I had contemplated inviting her numerous times, yet it felt peculiar; our neighbors here tend to keep their distance, and we prefer to maintain a semblance of space to avoid potential conflicts.

Though I had never seen her up close, she appeared to be quite lovely, with shoulder-length brown hair and a penchant for headbands and large earrings. She seemed to possess a wicked sense of humor, and my friend’s exchanges with her were laced with flirtation, as I gleaned from his screen. I chose to keep her identity as my neighbor a secret—I intended to play my own game.

Once I returned home, I retrieved my phone, adjusted the age range and distance parameters, and began my search. It was a stroke of luck; her profile picture appeared almost immediately. We matched, but I still needed her to respond, so I set my phone aside and occupied myself with other tasks. When I checked back, she had indeed matched and we embarked on a conversation that unfolded somewhat like this.

— Hi, aren’t you my neighbor from the pool behind? — she dove straight in.

— Wow, now I’m blushing, where do I hide my face? — I feigned embarrassment.

— How strange! We’ve never spoken, and yet this happens!

Our conversation transitioned to WhatsApp, where the banter flowed effortlessly. We joked about the fact that I had never invited her for a swim on those hot days.

— Well, we can rectify that; it’s supposed to be sunny tomorrow, are you up for it?

— Sure, why not!

— Great, just hop over the wall when you wake up tomorrow!

— Sounds good, maybe I should bring a ladder?

It was settled: she would come over in the morning around eleven, and we would lounge around, sipping beers and listening to music. As for my friend? He need not know! I could easily claim ignorance regarding the photo.

The next day, when she arrived, I greeted her with enthusiasm. She was dressed for the beach, sporting shorts and a light top that hinted at her bikini underneath. I showed her around the house, pointed out the bathroom and refrigerator, and we took our first dive into the pool, enjoying a few beers at the edge; the sun blazed overhead.

— I’m going to get a tan line from this bikini, I didn’t want that. — she remarked, inspecting her shoulder for any signs of sunburn.

— I noticed you don’t have any bikini lines. Do you go topless?

— Whenever I sunbathe, I try to; I dislike the lines when I wear dresses or open tops. — She casually revealed her upper torso; her breasts were indeed beautiful.

— I know it would be rather naughty of me, but feel free to take off the top if you wish.

— Oh sure, you’d enjoy that, wouldn’t you? Just waiting to gawk at my breasts like a creep?

— Not like a creep, but I won’t deny I might glance a bit.

— You men are all the same; can’t resist a glimpse of breasts. I have no issues with that.

— Please, go ahead!

And she truly did; turning her back to me, with a swift motion, she untied her top and tossed it onto a nearby chair, perhaps out of shyness or some other reason, she dipped into the water just enough to keep her breasts concealed. I desperately tried not to stare, wishing to make her feel at ease.

— I feel like I should remove something too to keep it fair, but if I do, I’d be at a disadvantage.

— Are we competing now? No one told me! — she laughed, looking at me.

The day was turning out to be incredibly enjoyable; she swam over to my side, and we engaged in light conversation. I sensed her attraction to me, and I began to drop some classic flirtations, the details of which I shall refrain from sharing to spare myself the embarrassment. Suddenly, she kissed me. It was an electrifying kiss, and the atmosphere quickly intensified as our hands roamed beneath the water. Her figure was firm and well-defined, suggesting a commitment to fitness; I could feel her breasts pressing against me, their consistency evident in our embrace.

As our kiss deepened, I became aware of my arousal beneath my swim trunks, and she didn’t hesitate to comment when she noticed.

— Looks like someone is getting excited, huh? — A mischievous grin spread across her face.

— That’s the effect you have on men!

Without hesitation, she resumed kissing me and reached inside my swim trunks, her gentle touch only heightened my desire. The feather-light caress felt like silk against my skin.

— Are you sure no one can see us here?

— The only one who might is a gorgeous neighbor over there, but today it seems she’s out with some handsome guy. — I quipped, pointing toward her house.

— Sit over there on the stairs, please.

I moved to the shallow end, where the water barely covered me, leaving my torso exposed. With a patient smile, she tied her hair back and lowered herself toward me—truly, I was a lucky man, with a precious gem residing next door whom I had failed to notice. She assessed my situation with a calm demeanor.

— My word! — The sheer joy on her face upon seeing my arousal sent waves of excitement coursing through me; it’s delightful to know you are pleasing someone.

She leaned down and began kissing the tip of my member with tender kisses. I struggled to find a comfortable position in the shallow water, my body growing weak from the warmth of her mouth; I could feel her tongue swirling within her mouth, and it was exhilaratingly dangerous, as she could bring me to climax at any moment with a slight increase in intensity. Not content, she opened her mouth wide and enveloped me, clearly eager to impress me with her skills. She took me almost entirely, sucking slowly, then gradually increasing the pressure, twisting her head as she reached the tip.

— I’m going to cum this way; perhaps it’s best that I take my turn to pleasure you now, for the love of God.

She laughed at my urgency and switched places with me, choosing to sit on the edge on a towel so she could lie back. I began by kissing her lips, gradually traveling to her neck and caressing the skin of her breasts; they were firm and perky, a lovely shade of brown with well-defined, symmetrical nipples. I dedicated time to each, showering them with kisses and gentle caresses, followed by light sucking. She playfully pushed my head down, teasing me, and I chuckled as I descended.

Her lacy bikini bottom was easily removed, revealing to me a neatly groomed pubis with a bit of hair trimmed high, and nothing covering her outer labia. Her interior blossomed like a flower, its hues mirroring those of her breasts, a dark and beautiful brown. Even wet from the pool, I could see her arousal glistening, a solitary drop begging to be licked. With a welcoming kiss, I paid homage to every part of her sex, keenly observing her reactions. Her fingers wove through my hair, beckoning me to dive deeper. My tongue was enveloped in a slightly salty taste, the sensation of her soft and wet flesh was intoxicating; she pulsed with every lick I delivered, alternating between clenching and surrendering to my ministrations.

Her moans escalated to fervent cries, she cursed and ground against my face, eager to assert her dominance, only pausing when overwhelmed by pleasure, surrendering to a powerful orgasm brought forth by my mouth. A long, drawn-out cry escaped her lips, fading into a blissful, sheepish smile.

— My goodness, that was intense... — she laughed, looking at me — Is there more where that came from?

I wouldn’t let her leave her spot; I pulled her closer so I could kiss her, and without the use of my hands, I positioned myself at her entrance, clumsily forcing my way inside. There was no resistance, the moisture allowing me to slide deep within her in one swift motion, feeling the depths of her channel. I heard another exclamation that sounded akin to gratitude as I began to establish a rhythm that gradually increased with her reactions.

I pulled her closer, still connected, as I moved through the water, she was powerless, merely cursing incoherently in my ear while I thrust into her. Weary of drifting and thrusting, I turned her body against the edge of the pool, exposing her on all fours before me; I penetrated her again without gentleness, gripping her hair tightly and squeezing her neck as I thrust with intense fervor. It wasn’t long before I felt my climax approaching; it surged powerfully, and I held back just enough to ensure she could experience her second release, and together we reached our peaks, culminating in a warm release deep within her.

— I’m spent; wait, this is going to hurt tomorrow!

— Apologies if I got carried away. Would you like to exit the pool?

I conclude my account here, but we ascended to my room after sharing a meal, and we became recurring lovers for quite some time; I always say that the best may be right next door, one just needs to be aware.
