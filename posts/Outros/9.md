Europe. The word reverberated in my mind like a siren's song, luring me away from familiar shores and into an ocean of possibilities. And there I was, in the midst of a challenging journey, sharing my small universe with three distinct souls: two young men and one girl, each carrying the essence of their native lands. One of them, an Italian, seemed sculpted by the gods of the Mediterranean. With an imposing stature, a square jaw, stubble, and hair that danced around his shoulders like dark waves, he was a sight to behold. His smile... oh, his smile! It was as if the sun of Tuscany had nestled upon his lips, radiating a warmth that reached the deepest recesses of my soul.

I was welcomed with a warmth that contrasted sharply with the chill of the cobblestone streets. He, with his melodic voice, introduced me to the others and guided me to my sanctuary on the second floor, a cozy room at the end of the hallway, near the bathroom. The house, modest and two-storied, blended seamlessly with the others on the street, as if it had always belonged there. Despite its size, there was a warmth, an intimacy that enveloped us all.

The Irishman, who occupied the main room on the ground floor, was entangled in a romance with a girl from the city, while the French girl isolated herself in her spacious attic. I, alone in my small room, felt my heart race every time the Italian drew near. And I was not alone in this; the French girl also seemed enchanted by his presence, creating between us a silent competition, a dance of glances and subtle gestures, each of us vying for his attention while concealing our true desires.

One of my tactics was to leave my door slightly ajar, an innocent trap. At times, I would catch glimpses of him passing by, his eyes scanning the shadows of my space where I found myself in moments of almost bare intimacy. Yet he never dared to enter, never commented on what he saw. It was a game of silent voyeurism, feeding my hopes and doubts. Was he shy? Respectful? Or perhaps... gay?

One night, while everyone reveled in the living room over a football game, I decided to make another attempt. I ascended, adorned in a pink satin nightgown that left little to the imagination, extinguished the corridor lights, and lit candles, creating a seductive atmosphere. I left the door ajar and lay on the bed, headphones in place, pretending to hum as I caressed my breasts.

It wasn’t long before I heard footsteps in the hallway, followed by an abrupt silence. A figure materialized in the doorway, observing me intently. Was it him? My heart raced. But then, a feminine voice, in French, broke the silence:

"Ça va?"

The French girl entered, closing the door behind her. I stood frozen, unsure of what to expect. She sat beside me, her intense gaze ensnaring me in a spell. The scent of her desire hung palpably in the air, her hand timidly reaching toward my body. A gentle, sensual touch, like an invitation.

I gazed into her eyes, biting my lips, my hand seeking her thighs. Fear and excitement intertwined within me. Was it real? Or merely a cruel game?

She caressed my breast, her nails teasing my nipples, sending shivers across my skin. I surrendered to the moment, my body responding to her touch. It felt as if our spirits were connecting in a cosmic dance.

Then, she stood, her eyes still locked onto mine, and disrobed, revealing her slender, delicate form. She approached, her warm body molding against mine. Her lips met mine in a kiss that was at once wild and tender, stealing my soul and leading me to uncharted territories.

In that room, beneath the candlelight, I discovered a new world, an ocean of sensations I had never explored. And as I lost myself in her embrace, I forgot the Italian, forgot the competition, forgot everything except the present moment and the intense connection we shared.

She abruptly descended, taking my underwear with her, discarding it upon the floor, examining me with an expression of desire and a playful smile on her lips. She lowered herself, kissing me with fervor. I was carried away by her mouth, feeling her tongue traverse my shame as I could hear the sound of her kisses, strong and precise. With each suck, I writhed further, consumed and surrendered to that woman. Her fingers buried inside me, touching my most pleasurable spot with short, deliberate movements. I spilled forth into her mouth, yearning to be engulfed by her. A powerful orgasm surged forth, crashing over me like a tidal wave of ecstasy, leaving me there, shattered and spent.

She cast her gaze upon my body with an intensity that made me tremble. In a sudden motion, she tore away my intimate garments, discarding them to the floor as if they were mere petals from a flower that had already blossomed. Her eyes, gleaming with desire and a mischievous smile, examined me with a hunger I had never experienced. And then, she leaned in, her warm mouth approaching my intimate core.

I was consumed by her mouth, her tongue dancing upon my skin with a skill that drove me to madness. The sound of her kisses echoed in the room, strong and precise, each suck drawing me into a rising ecstasy. My fingers clawed at the sheets, holding on as I surrendered completely to that woman and her magical caresses.

Her fingers, long and nimble, found my most sensitive point, teasing it with short and intense movements. My moans escaped like husky whispers, my body melting into a sea of pleasure. I spilled forth into her mouth, longing to be devoured by her, consumed by her passion.

And then, it happened. An overwhelming orgasm crashed over me like a colossal wave, propelling me to unimaginable heights. My body convulsed, arching in spasms of pure pleasure. And when it finally subsided, I lay there, broken and exhausted, yet more alive than ever.

She rose, her face flushed and her lips glistening with my nectar. Her eyes met mine, and in that gaze, there lay a profound connection, an intimacy that transcended words. In that moment, I knew something had shifted within me. The French girl, with her magical touch, had awakened a part of me I had not even known existed.

And as I watched her dress, a smile formed on my lips. Perhaps the Italian was not the only treasure I would uncover in this European adventure. Perhaps the true treasure was the discovery of myself.
